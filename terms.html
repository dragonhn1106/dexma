                sole discretion. Using a particular form of notice in some instances does not obligate us to use the
                same form in other instances. Any changes or modifications will be effective immediately upon posting
                the revisions to the Site, and will apply to your subsequent use of the Site. You waive any right you

                without notice. In this case, you may be prevented from accessing or using our Services. If, in our
                sole discretion, we decide to permanently discontinue our Services, we will provide you with notice via
                our website.
            </p>
            <h3>Eligibility</h3>
            <p class="lead">By accessing or using the Site, you represent and warrant that you have not previously been
                suspended or removed from the Site. You must be an individual of at least 13 years of age. You can use
                our Services only if you can lawfully enter into an agreement to these Terms under applicable law. If

                regulations. You further represent and warrant that you will not use the Site if the laws of your
                country prohibit you from doing so in accordance with these Terms.
            </p>
            <h3>Registration and Account</h3>
            <p class="lead">In order to access and use certain features on the Site, you must create an account with
                Dexma ("Account"). You agree to: (a) provide accurate, current and complete information when creating
                or updating an Account; (b) maintain and promptly update your Account information; (c) maintain the
                security and confidentiality of your login credentials and restrict access to your Account and your
                computer; (d) promptly notify Dexma if you discover or otherwise suspect any security breaches related
                to the Site; (e) activate Two-Step-Verification via a mobile application or SMS text messages; and (d)

                    for an unauthorized access to accounts with inactive Two-Step Verification.</b>
            </p>
            <h3>Account Suspension & Closure</h3>
            <p class="lead">We may, without liability to you or any third party, refuse to let you open an account,
                suspend your account, or terminate your account or your use of one or more of the Services. Such
                actions may be taken as a result of account inactivity, failure to positively identify yourself, if we
                believe your account has been compromised, in order for us to comply with laws or regulations, or your
                violation of the terms of this Agreement. If you have cryptocurrency remaining in an account, which has
                been suspended or closed, you will be able to access such cryptocurrency and withdraw them to an
                external cryptocurrency address (unless prohibited by law or a court order). If you are unable to login
                to your account because it has been suspended, you must contact us at contact@cryptonator.com to
                process such withdrawal. If you have linked a bank account, debit card, or credit card to your account,
                we reserve the right to require you to provide further identifying information before processing such
                withdrawal or transfer.
            </p>
            <p class="lead">You may terminate this Agreement at any time by closing your account and discontinuing use
                of the Services. Upon termination of this Agreement and your account, you remain liable for all
                transactions made while the account was open.
            </p>
            <h3>Dormant Accounts </h3>
            <p class="lead">A Dormant Account is defined as a user account with no login or other activity for more
                than 180 days. Dexma may, but shall not be obligated to, move funds out of the account and into a
                secure Cold Storage account for safe keeping. When a user resumes activity on a dormant account, the
                Cold Storage funds can be retrieved by contacting support for a security review and reinstatement.
            </p>
            <h3>Transaction Limits and Refunds</h3>
            <p class="lead">Dexma reserves the right to change the deposit, withdrawal, conversion, storage, and
                velocity limits on your account as well as the availability of the Services as we deem reasonably
                necessary. Once a cryptocurrency transaction has been initiated, it cannot be reversed or refunded.</p>
            <h3>Refill</h3>
            <p class="lead">To withdraw funds required test completion. All entrants voluntary, non-refundable.</p>

            <h3>Privacy Policy</h3>
            <p class="lead">Please refer to our <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a> for information about how we
                collect, use, and share your personal information.</p>
            <h3>Confidentiality of Transmissions Over the Internet</h3>
            <p class="lead">The transmission of data or information (including communications by e-mail) over the
                Internet or other publicly accessible networks is not one hundred percent secure, and is subject to
                possible loss, interception, or alteration while in transit. Accordingly, Dexma does not assume any
                liability for any damage you may experience or costs you may incur as a result of any transmissions
                over the Internet or other publicly accessible networks, including without limitation transmissions
                involving the exchange of e-mail with Dexma containing your personal information. While Dexma shall
                take commercially reasonable efforts to safeguard the privacy of the information you provide to Dexma
                and shall treat such information in accordance with Dexma's Privacy Policy, in no event will the
                information you provide to Dexma be deemed to be confidential, create any fiduciary obligations to you
                on Dexma's part, or result in any liability to you on Dexma's part in the event that such information
                is inadvertently released by Dexma or accessed by third parties without Dexma's consent.</p>
            <h3>Cryptocurrency Transactions</h3>
            <p class="lead">Dexma cannot and does not guarantee the value of cryptocurrency. You acknowledge and agree
                that the value of cryptocurrency is highly volatile and that buying, selling, and holding
                cryptocurrency involves a high risk. Additionally, the cryptocurrency consensus network is solely
                responsible for verifying and confirming proposed transactions that you submit via the Services, and
                Dexma cannot and does not confirm, cancel, or reverse cryptocurrency-to-cryptocurrency transactions,
                other than confirmation of the cryptocurrency network’s completion of a transaction. </p>
            <p class="lead">The cryptocurrency network is operated by a decentralized network of independent third
                parties. Once a transaction request has been submitted to the cryptocurrency network via the Services,
                the cryptocurrency network will automatically complete or reject the request and you will not be able
                to cancel or otherwise modify your transaction request. You acknowledge and agree that Dexma is not
                responsible for any errors or omissions that you make in connection with any cryptocurrency transaction
                initiated via the Services. The Services help you submit your cryptocurrency transaction request for
                confirmation to the cryptocurrency network. However, Dexma has no control over the cryptocurrency
                network and therefore cannot and does not ensure that any transaction request you submit via the
                Services will be completed. You acknowledge and agree that the transaction requests you submit via the
                Services may not be completed, or may be substantially delayed, by the cryptocurrency network. When you
                complete a transaction request via the Services, you authorize us to submit your transaction request to
                the cryptocurrency network in accordance with the instructions you provide via the Services.</p>
            <h3>Third Party Applications</h3>
            <p class="lead">If you grant express permission to a third party to connect to your account, either through
                the third party's product or through Dexma, you acknowledge that granting permission to a third party
                to take specific actions on your behalf does not relieve you of any of your responsibilities under this
                Agreement. Further, you acknowledge and agree that you will not hold Dexma responsible for, and will
                indemnify Dexma from, any liability arising from the actions or inactions of this third party in
                connection with the permissions you grant.</p>
            <h3>Application Programming Interface</h3>
            <p class="lead">Any person or entity who uses Dexma 's Application Programming Interface ("Dexma API") must
                comply with the terms of this User Agreement and/or any other conditions as Dexma may put into place in
                its sole discretion from time to time. The Dexma API is owned by Dexma and is licensed to Dexma API
                users on a non-exclusive, non-sublicensable basis.</p>
            <h3>Changes to this Agreement</h3>
            <p class="lead">You can review the most current version of the Terms of Service at any time at this page.
                We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to update, change or replace any part of these Terms of
                Service by posting updates and changes to our website. It is your responsibility to check our website
                periodically for changes. Your continued use of or access to our website or the Service following the
                posting of any changes to these Terms of Service constitutes acceptance of those changes. </p>
            <h3>Force Majeure</h3>
            <p class="lead">We shall not be liable for delays, failure in performance or interruption of service which
                result directly or indirectly from any cause or condition beyond our reasonable control, including but
                not limited to, any delay or failure due to any act of God, act of civil or military authorities, act
                of terrorists, civil disturbance, war, strike or other labor dispute, fire, interruption in
                telecommunications or Internet services or network provider services, failure of equipment and/or
                software, other catastrophe or any other occurrence which is beyond our reasonable control and shall
                not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.</p>
            <h3>Change of Control</h3>
            <p class="lead">In the event that Dexma is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the
                right, in any of these circumstances, to transfer or assign the information we have collected from you
                as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control.</p>
            <h3>Export Controls</h3>
            <p class="lead">The Dexma Services may be subject to export control regulations under applicable law. By
                using the Dexma Services you represent that you are not an individual or entity that is, or an entity
                owned or controlled by persons or entities that are, (i) the subject of any sanctions administered or
                enforced by the U.S. Department of the Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control, the U.S. Department
                of State, the United Nations Security Council, the European Union, Her Majesty’s Treasury, the Hong
                Kong government, or any other governmental authority with jurisdiction over Dexma or the Dexma
                Services; (ii) identified on the Denied Persons, Entity, or Unverified Lists of the U.S. Department of
                Commerce’s Bureau of Industry and Security; or (iii) located, organized or resident in a country or

                court having jurisdiction may be entered upon the arbitrator's award. </p>
